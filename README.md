# telegram-chatbot
Create a telegram chatbot using python.
There are 4 functions in the chatbot:
1. According the special needs, help you generate the meal plan
2. Help you to find the cook video
3. Analyze the nutrient in a receipt including calories and protein
4. Can have some simple conversation with you, like tell you some joke

API:

Receipe - Food - Nutrition API which I find in Rapid API Market

Finally, thanks for professor Fan Zhang and my group members, I have done this project with their help.
